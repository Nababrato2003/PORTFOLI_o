# A modern, dynamic, and fully responsive personal portfolio website. This project showcases skills, projects, and experience with a clean, minimalist "Aurora" theme, featuring a professional teal and green gradient and engaging interactive UI elements.
ðŸš€ Features
Clean "Aurora" Theme: A professional and eye-catching design with a beautiful teal and green gradient accent.

Subtle Animated Background: A lightweight and elegant aurora gradient effect in the hero section that is less distracting than particle animations.

Interactive Card Glow: Cards feature a subtle background glow that follows the mouse cursor and an animated border on hover.

Dynamic Typing Animation: The hero section subtitle uses a typewriter effect to introduce your professional title.

Scroll-Reveal Animations: Sections gracefully fade and slide into view as you scroll, powered by the IntersectionObserver API.

Glassmorphism UI: The sticky navigation bar has a sleek, semi-transparent "glass" effect that floats above the content.

Fully Responsive Design: Built with Tailwind CSS, the layout adapts perfectly to all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

Self-Contained: The entire website is a single index.html file, making it incredibly easy to customize and deploy.
